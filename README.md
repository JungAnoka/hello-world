# hello-world
My main priorities are identifying and developing new federal agencies, markets, and opportunities to drive our new federal business pipeline; and, developing and maintaining relationships with our key commercial partners, government agency officials, and other stakeholders. 
I currently work closely with the founder/CTO of ThinkTrends, as well as the COO and the President of BITS.
